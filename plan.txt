I would like to do days of advent 1-5 for 2015 & 2024
Then if feeling able to go further for 2024
By around 10-15 I would like to focus on a data-type project
Ideally I would have a conclusion to draw from the data - something 
physics based would be perfect.

Things to work on:
    - Pushing to git more.
        - So push more!
    - Stop overcomplicating things!
        - No more superfluous functions to validate data!
    - Run pytest more!
        - Run pytest after each major addition.

Things to learn:
    - Test parameterisation of tests.
        - Rewrite test files as paramaterisation.
    - Github workflows.
        - Make a workflow that puts badge of pytest % and pylint score
    - Using the any() method
        - Rewrite day two validate function to use any()

Data Project:
    - Tracking the decline of RTS video games across time
    - Compare to other genres
    - Releases across time
    - Concurrent players
    - Sales figures

    SteamDB? MobiGames? Need to look for APIs.
