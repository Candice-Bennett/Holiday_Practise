I would like to do days of advent 1-5 for 2015 & 2024
Then if feeling able to go further for 2024
By around 10-15 I would like to focus on a data-type project
Ideally I would have a conclusion to draw from the data - something 
physics based would be perfect.

Things to work on:
    - Pushing to git more.


Things to learn:
    - Test parameterisation of tests.
